# SignalForge - A Real-Time Signal Processing Framework

SignalForge provides a robust and efficient framework for real-time signal processing applications built using the Go programming language. It leverages Go's concurrency model and performance characteristics to offer a highly scalable and customizable solution for analyzing and manipulating data streams.

SignalForge aims to simplify the development of complex signal processing pipelines. It offers a modular architecture that allows developers to easily integrate custom signal processing algorithms and data sources. The framework provides built-in support for common signal processing tasks such as filtering, spectral analysis, and feature extraction. It is designed to be adaptable to a wide range of applications, from audio and video processing to financial data analysis and industrial control systems.

This project prioritizes performance and low latency. The core components are optimized for speed and efficient memory usage, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments. It also emphasizes extensibility, allowing developers to add new signal processing algorithms and data sources without modifying the core framework. The comprehensive API and clear documentation facilitate rapid development and deployment of real-time signal processing solutions.

SignalForge offers a powerful toolset for creating sophisticated signal processing applications. Whether you need to analyze audio streams, monitor sensor data, or process financial transactions in real-time, SignalForge provides a solid foundation for building reliable and performant solutions.

Key Features:

*   **Concurrent Processing:** Utilizes Go's goroutines and channels to enable parallel processing of data streams, maximizing throughput and minimizing latency. Each stage of the signal processing pipeline can be executed concurrently, allowing for efficient utilization of multi-core processors.
*   **Modular Pipeline Architecture:** Allows developers to define signal processing pipelines as a series of interconnected modules. Each module encapsulates a specific signal processing algorithm and can be easily added, removed, or reconfigured. This modularity promotes code reusability and simplifies maintenance.
*   **Custom Algorithm Integration:** Provides a flexible interface for integrating custom signal processing algorithms written in Go. Developers can easily implement their own algorithms and incorporate them into the SignalForge pipeline. This is achieved using a defined interface `SignalProcessor` which requires `Process(data []float64) []float64` method.
*   **Built-in Signal Processing Modules:** Includes a collection of pre-built signal processing modules for common tasks such as filtering (e.g., moving average, Butterworth filters implemented using digital filter design techniques), spectral analysis (e.g., FFT, spectrogram), and feature extraction (e.g., peak detection, energy calculation). The filtering modules are implemented using biquad filter sections for improved stability.
*   **Real-Time Data Streaming:** Supports real-time data streaming from various sources, including audio interfaces, network sockets, and files. The data streaming is handled using Go's I/O libraries and can be easily adapted to support custom data sources.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Implements robust error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure the reliability and stability of the signal processing pipeline. All errors are logged using a configurable logging system, and appropriate error recovery mechanisms are implemented to prevent pipeline failures.
*   **Configurable Parameters:** Allows developers to configure the parameters of each signal processing module through a simple configuration file. This allows for easy customization of the signal processing pipeline without modifying the code. The configuration is handled through `json` and allows setting gain, frequency and other parameters specific to each module.

Technology Stack:

*   **Go:** The primary programming language used to build SignalForge. Go's concurrency model and performance characteristics make it well-suited for real-time signal processing applications.
*   **Go Standard Library:** Provides core functionalities such as I/O, concurrency, and data structures.
*   **JSON:** Utilized for configuration file parsing, enabling flexible parameterization of the signal processing pipeline. The `encoding/json` package from the Go standard library is used.
*   **(Optional) Gonum:** A set of libraries for numerical computation in Go. It could be used for more advanced signal processing algorithms such as matrix operations and linear algebra.

Installation:

1.  Ensure you have Go installed and configured correctly. Check with `go version`.
2.  Clone the SignalForge repository from GitHub:
    git clone https://github.com/ezozu/SignalForge.git
3.  Navigate to the SignalForge directory:
    cd SignalForge
4.  Download the necessary dependencies using Go modules:
    go mod download
5.  Build the SignalForge executable:
    go build -o signalforge main.go

Configuration:

SignalForge utilizes a `config.json` file to configure the signal processing pipeline. The `config.json` file should be located in the same directory as the SignalForge executable.
The configuration file defines the modules in the pipeline, their order, and their parameters.

Example `config.json`:

{
    "pipeline": [
        {
            "type": "filter",
            "name": "ButterworthFilter",
            "parameters": {
                "frequency": 1000,
                "order": 4
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "fft",
            "name": "FastFourierTransform",
            "parameters": {
                "windowSize": 1024
            }
        }
    ]
}

Environment Variables:

*   `SIGNALFORGE_LOG_LEVEL`: Sets the logging level. Possible values: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`. Defaults to `info`.

Usage:

Run the SignalForge executable:
./signalforge

The executable will read the `config.json` file and start the signal processing pipeline.

Example Programmatically:

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/ezozu/SignalForge/pkg/pipeline"
)

func main() {
    pipe, err := pipeline.NewPipeline("config.json")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error creating pipeline:", err)
        return
    }
    data := []float64{1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0}
    processedData, err := pipe.Process(data)
    if err != nil {
      fmt.Println("Error processing data: ", err)
      return
    }
    fmt.Println("Processed data:", processedData)

}
